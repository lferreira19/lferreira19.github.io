A little bit about me...
 <ul>
 	I am from Long Island, New York and I graduated high school from J.L.M. Great Neck North in 2011. While attending 
 	high school I was captain of the cross country, winter track, and spring track teams. I also volunteered in local
 	middle school math classes where I taught lessons and tutored students. 
 	<br><br>
 	As a high school student I my favoirte subject was math. I wasn't particularlly interested in computer science. 
 	I entered college as a math major where I was required to take one computer science course. I instantly fell in 
 	love with the subject and swithced
 	over to the dark side. 
 	<br>
 </ul>
 
 Currently...
 <ul>
 	I am currently a student at Salisbury University majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics, expecting 
 	to graduate in the spring of 2016. I play Women's Rugby for the university and I am our team's fundraising chair. I 
 	spent the 2012-2013 winter semester studying philosophy abroad in India which was a truely remarkable experience! I 
 	am also a member of the schools math and computer science club. Our club works to expose young local children to the 
 	wonders of math and computer science! (We also work to remind each other how wonderful these feilds are when we are 
 	facing hours apon hours of studying and programming). In addition, am a member of the Bellavance Honors Program. For 
 	the 2014 fall semester I look foward to taking Systems Software, Advanced Data Structures, and Accient World
 	Civilizations.
